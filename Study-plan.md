# Study Plan For DevOps

## Preview

The Goald of the Study Plan is not to master everything but at least to have some exposure.
there are few things that need more than just knowledge specially `Container`, `CI/CD`, `Terraform` In my opinion this are the core essential in DevOps nowdays. Therfore, Here are some few bullet point that will serve you as Basic Guide.


1. **CI/CD**

    * Deploy Jenkins server andand Gitlab just get familiar with.
    * `Gitlab` (build a pipeine in Gitlab I recommend using Gilab.com), and `Jenkins` 

2. **Ansible basic** 

    * Setup sensible server with 2 targets server and write a playbook to deploy nginx to the target server
    * Understand the use of a role in Ansible 
    * Understand the use of Handler in Ansible
    * write another playbook to update your target server (Make use of Ansible Module)

3. **Container Basic** 

    * Build different type of container (this process is call dockerize and application)
    * if you are building a web server container run in try to deploy that new container in k8s env (minikube).

4. **Kubernetes basic**

    * Deployment
    * service
    * pods
    * understand the Kubernetes Architecture (The main componants of k8s)
    * get familiar with some basic interview questions and answers.

5. **Terraform Basic**

    * Deploy infrastructure on AWS ( VPC, EC2, S3, etc...)
    * if possible try to deploy EKS using terraform (bonus you can do it in conjunction with Ansible)
    * Get familiar with some basic interview questions and answers as well.

6. **AWS Cloud Basic**

    * Focus on the AWS Solution Architect Associate Certification
    * get a good knowledge of Networking in the cloud (VPC, Subnet, Loadbalancer, etc...) and Security Group
    * Get a good knowledge of compute storage (s3, Glacier etc...)
    * get a good knowledge of IAM

7. **Basic Linux Fundamentals**

    * Bash Script on centos or ubuntu (to Create user, update package, and deploy lambstack)
    * Basic linux command line.


**Note** `There is no oder to go about this you pick one and you make a check list about what you covered alreay`
